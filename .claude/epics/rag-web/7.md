# Task: RAG Integration

## Description
Connect chat interface to existing search/analysis endpoints and integrate with FastAPI backend for dental knowledge queries using the existing RAG system.

## Acceptance Criteria  
- [ ] Integration with existing vector search endpoints
- [ ] Support for dental terminology and cephalometric analysis
- [ ] Context-aware conversation handling
- [ ] Source document references in responses
- [ ] Query preprocessing for dental domain
- [ ] Response streaming from RAG pipeline
- [ ] Fallback handling for search failures
- [ ] Integration with existing document processing

## Technical Details
- Leverage existing dental_rag/backend search and document services
- Integrate with current Chroma vector database setup
- Use existing document processor and vector service patterns
- Implement conversation context injection for RAG queries
- Add dental-specific query enhancement and preprocessing
- Support for both Japanese and English dental terminology
- Maintain existing performance optimizations

## Dependencies
- Task 004: Core Chat UI (chat interface components)
- Task 005: Conversation Persistence (conversation storage)
- Existing dental_rag backend services (vector_service, document_service)
- Current Chroma DB setup and indexed documents

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 16-24 hours  
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] RAG pipeline integrated with chat interface
- [ ] Dental knowledge queries working end-to-end
- [ ] Source document references displayed in UI
- [ ] Context injection for multi-turn conversations
- [ ] Unit tests for integration components written and passing
- [ ] Integration tests with existing RAG system
- [ ] Performance testing with realistic queries
- [ ] Error handling for RAG pipeline failures
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Documentation updated with RAG integration details
