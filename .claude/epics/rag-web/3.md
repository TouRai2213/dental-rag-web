# Task: Authentication Flow

## Description
Implement simple email/password authentication system with session management and user state handling. Create login/register forms and protect routes that require authentication.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Login form with email/password validation
- [ ] Registration form with email/password/confirm password
- [ ] Session management (JWT or similar)
- [ ] User state management (context or state management library)
- [ ] Protected routes middleware
- [ ] Logout functionality
- [ ] Form validation and error handling
- [ ] Responsive design for auth forms

## Technical Details
- Use Next.js App Router for authentication routes
- Implement JWT-based authentication or NextAuth.js
- Create React context for user state management
- Use shadcn/ui components for forms (Input, Button, Card)
- Implement form validation with react-hook-form and zod
- Create middleware for route protection
- Handle authentication errors gracefully

## Dependencies
- Task 001 (Project Setup) must be completed
- Form validation library (react-hook-form, zod)
- Authentication library (NextAuth.js or custom JWT)
- Database connection for user storage

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 8-10 hours
- Parallel: true (can work alongside database setup)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Authentication system implemented and working
- [ ] All forms validate properly
- [ ] Session persistence works across browser refreshes
- [ ] Protected routes redirect to login when needed
- [ ] Tests written for authentication flows
- [ ] Code reviewed and follows project standards
