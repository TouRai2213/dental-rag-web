# Task: Database Schema

## Description
Create database schema for conversations, messages, and marked_documents tables. Set up database migrations and establish the foundational data structure for the dental RAG system.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Users table with authentication fields
- [ ] Conversations table with user relationships
- [ ] Messages table with conversation relationships and message types
- [ ] Marked_documents table for user document interactions
- [ ] Database migration scripts created
- [ ] Indexes created for performance optimization
- [ ] Foreign key constraints properly established
- [ ] Database connection configuration

## Technical Details
- Use PostgreSQL or SQLite for development
- Create migration scripts using preferred ORM (Prisma/Drizzle)
- Design schema with proper relationships:
  - Users (id, email, password_hash, created_at, updated_at)
  - Conversations (id, user_id, title, created_at, updated_at)
  - Messages (id, conversation_id, content, role, created_at)
  - Marked_documents (id, user_id, document_id, marked_at, notes)
- Add appropriate indexes for query performance
- Include soft delete capabilities where needed

## Dependencies
- Database system (PostgreSQL recommended)
- ORM/Query builder (Prisma, Drizzle, or similar)
- No internal dependencies (can run parallel to frontend setup)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 4-6 hours
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Database schema implemented and tested
- [ ] Migration scripts created and working
- [ ] Database seeds for development data
- [ ] Connection pooling configured
- [ ] Schema documentation updated
- [ ] Database backup/restore procedures documented
