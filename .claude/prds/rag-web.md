# PRD: rag-web

## Executive Summary

The rag-web feature is a comprehensive production-ready web interface for the Dental RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system. It transforms the existing proof-of-concept interfaces into a scalable, maintainable, and user-friendly application that enables dental professionals to leverage AI-powered cephalometric analysis, manage literature databases, and generate evidence-based clinical reports. The system integrates with existing vector databases, PostgreSQL storage, and GPU processing infrastructure while providing a modern, responsive interface suitable for clinical environments.

## Problem Statement

The current system has functional but disconnected test interfaces (chat.html and index.html) that lack production-ready features essential for clinical use. Dental professionals need a unified, reliable, and efficient web application that can:
- Provide persistent conversation management similar to ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini
- Enable both patient-specific analysis and general dental knowledge queries
- Handle complex patient data input and analysis workflows
- Maintain conversation history across sessions for each user
- Support contextual follow-up questions on generated reports
- Manage and search across vast dental literature databases
- Generate evidence-based reports with proper citation tracking
- Support session-level document weighting for personalized analysis
- Provide administrative controls for system configuration

Without a proper production interface with conversation management, users cannot effectively leverage the AI assistant for both structured analysis and exploratory discussions, limiting the system's value as a comprehensive dental knowledge platform.
